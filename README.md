##  About Me

-  **Educator for over 12 years**, with experience as a music teacher, administrator, and most recently, a computer science teacher at a Williamsburg high school.  
-  **Senior Lead Instructor at The Marcy Lab School**, leading fellows in technical instruction with clarity, care, and lots of love.  
-  Born in **Puebla, Mexico**, and raised in **South Brooklyn**â€”I now live just a few neighborhoods away and plan to stay put.  
-  A master at absorbing large amounts of information and distilling it into digestible, engaging lessonsâ€”bringing clarity and fun to every lecture.  
-  When I'm not teaching future engineers, youâ€™ll often find me ice skating, playing hockey, playing chess, or skateboardingâ€”usually while listening to my eclectic *Skate* playlist (rap, punk/alt rock, TSwift, screamo, and EDM).  
-  Skilled in **JavaScript**, **Python**, **React**, and more.  
-  Committed to bringing **software engineering education** to learners who might not otherwise have access.
